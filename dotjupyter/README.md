# VIM key bindings for Jupyter

This folder should be linked or copied to `~/.jupyter`.  Note that it does not set a password!

Installation of the vim binding pluging is as per [instructions](https://github.com/lambdalisue/jupyter-vim-binding).

Tested using the following installation:

```bash
dotjupyter [master] $ jupyter --version
jupyter core     : 4.6.1
jupyter-notebook : 6.0.2
...
```
